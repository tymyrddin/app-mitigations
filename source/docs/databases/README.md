# Databases

* Base validation on a whitelist: accept data fitting a specified structure, instead of rejecting patterns.
* [Give me parameterized SQL, or give me death](https://blog.codinghorror.com/give-me-parameterized-sql-or-give-me-death/). Instead of concatenating strings, use secure database components such as stored procedures, parametrised queries, and object bindings for commands, or a Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
* Implement access control schemes. Restrict access to database objects and functionality, according to the Principle of Least Privilege (Insecure direct object references)
