# SQL injection mitigations

## Parameterized statements

A specific SQL injection software defense is the use of parameterised statements. 
[Give me parameterised SQL, or give me death](https://blog.codinghorror.com/give-me-parameterized-sql-or-give-me-death/). 
Instead of concatenating strings, use secure database components such as stored procedures, parametrised queries, and 
object bindings for commands, or an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
For example, in Java uses a PreparedStatement class rather than concatenating the user-provided strings in a query.

## Input validation
Having an input validation framework is an excellent way to prevent all kinds of zero-day exploits â€” not just SQL injection.
Single quotes or semicolons in a credit card number or numeric user ID are really not needed.
Better yet, base validation on a whitelist: accept data fitting a specified structure, instead of rejecting patterns.
