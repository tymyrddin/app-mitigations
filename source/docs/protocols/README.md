# Overview

* Use protocol algorithms that are currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and select well-tested implementations.
* For countering spoofing and session hijacking:
  * Use Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), HTTP Secure (HTTPS) and other secure communications protocols that encrypt data before it is sent and authenticate data as it is received.
  * Use additional multistep authentication methods.
