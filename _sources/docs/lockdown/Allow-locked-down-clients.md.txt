# Allow locked-down clients 

If a user has a locked-down client that does not support all the features used by your application, consider allowing that user some access, instead of completely denying access, which may force the user to degrade the client's security. This may help protect users and slow the propagation of malware.

* In a web environment, some users may have Javascript or browser plug-ins disabled for security, and requiring these features exposes them to attacks from other web sites.
